Alex's  growing list of scripts associated with the Genome Properties database. 
Many of them are helper functions and don't necessarily touch the Genome Properties
database on their own.
It was initially started by getting a list of all files in 
/usr/local/devel/ANNOTATION/hmm/utility 
that were owned by either Dan Haft or Jeremy Selengut, then asking Jeremy 
which of them were associated with Genome Properties and what they do,
then adding them to the project.

As unknowns get identified, they will be moved to categorized sections in this
list.


Scripts:
	Wrappers:
	  +---- 
	  | all_rules_vs_one_genome
	  | one_prop_vs_all_genomes
	  | one_prop_vs_some_genomes
	  | one_rule_vs_all_genomes
	  | one_rule_vs_some_genomes
	  +---- Evaluates rules or properties. "..._some_..." scripts only reevaluate those with YES or Some Evidence
		Initiate_genomes_for_properties_cron.sh -- sets environment vars and runs .pl
		Initiate_genomes_for_properties_cron.pl -- gets closed bacterial genomes not already evaluated and then runs Taxon_Loader, evaluates HMM %, and runs all_rules_vs_one_genome on each genome

	Property/Rule Evalators:
		GP_taxon_prop_loader.pl -- loads taxon properties for a genome (seems to be replaced by Taxon_*.pl, although most are assigned by this)
		phylogenomic_util/Taxon_loader.pl -- loads taxon properties for a genome
		phylogenomic_util/Taxon_exactifier.pl -- checks "inexact" taxon properties for possible updates in taxon db
		rule.spl -- evaluates a rule against a genome
		rule_new.spl -- rewrite of rule.sp
		load_AA_percents.pl -- calculates AA percentages for a genome
		calculate_amino_acid_composition.pl --unused (hard to read) variant of load_AA_percents.pl
		cluster_rules.spl -- checks if HMM % OK, then runs load_cluster_info.pl, then adds/replaces property 9119 (functional gene clustering - property level)
		load_cluster_info.sh -- sets environment vars and runs .pl
		load_cluster_info.pl -- fills or displays cluster_link table for 1+ genomes
		load_dinuc_thermo_metric.pl -- loads dinucleotide thermophily metric property
		load_GC_percent.pl -- loads GC percentage property
		load_HMM_ev_from_path_and_id.pl -- a way to manually run an hmm against all genomes and enter them into the db

	Property and Property Tree Modification:
		load_prop_lineage_specif.pl -- incomplete script to evaluate properties that are lineage-specific and set up a prop_link to ' META: Property profile - taxonomic lineage specificity'

	Property Reports:
		general_util/db_info.pl -- displays db2name and db_taxa nicely
		general_util/db2name.pl -- displays species name and stage for a db
		general_util/db_taxa.pl -- displays taxonomic tree for a db (from properties)
		prop_report.pl -- dumps property tree and values for a genome
		multi_db_prop_report.pl -- seems to do something similar to prop_report, but uglier
		prop_evaluate.pl -- dumps property step info for all genomes
		prop_step_evaluate.pl -- dumps property step evidence values for all genomes
		prop_details.pl -- dumps property info, steps, links, and applicable rule
		prop_step_align.pl -- prints fasta sequence of every locus that matches a particular prop_step. does not actually align
		prop_step_context.pl -- gets neigboring genes to an evaluated prop_step and analyses them for most common gene order
		property_go_report.pl -- list of ORFs with GO terms associated in a genome based on properties
	
	Genome Properties Utilities:
		GenProp_backup_cron.sh -- sets ENV and runs .pl
		GenProp_backup_cron.pl -- dumps select * runs for each table to disk
	
	Other DB utilities:
		load_GO_with_prop_def_id_and_db -- displays all ORFs in a genome_db with a substring in the gene common name
		
	Sequence Manipulation Utilities:
		general_util/dial -- runs dialign-t on foo.fa

	SGC Utilities:
		region_yank.pl -- simple genomic region display
		general_util/region_yank.pl
		general_util/searchcomname.pl -- searches for feature_name or common name
		general_util/ORFyank.pl -- gets protein sequence fasta for ORF_id and database
		
	Web Tools:
		prop_builder.cgi -- insert, view, edit properties

	No Function:
		frontend.cgi
