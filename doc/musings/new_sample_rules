# 1) divergon
# 2 genes in opposite orientation, within 500bp
# store actual distance x, identifiers of two genes

# 2) collision
# 2 genes pointing at each other and overlapping (in coding region)
# then
# store length of overlap, identifiers of two genes

# 3) trans-coupling 
# 2 genes in same direction with start codon of one overlapping stop of the other
# then
#   store identity of two genes and
#   overlap distance

# 3) and has a hit to sequence_id
