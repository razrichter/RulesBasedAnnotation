Functional Annotation
    Possible levels of functional annotation
        gene-by-gene, single organism
        genomic-context, single organism
        cross-organismic comparisons (e.g. synteny)
    Autoannotate (Phil)
        gene-by-gene
        HMMs
            Equivalog
            others at a lower priority
        Blast = BER - Gip/SGC only keeps top N hits
            Char hits
            Swissprot hits
            Others
        Other types as specified
        name modifications from e.g. signalp
    BrainGrab (Malay, Kevin)
        some gene-by-gene
        some gene-by-gene w/ organismic limits (e.g. clade-specific blast hit)
        some w/ genomic context
        Data types:
            Blast
            HMMs
            Genome Property values
        Levels
            On gene of interest (THIS)
            In operon/region (NEAR)
            presence in genome (GENOME)
        
    Genome Properties (Alex)
        a bunch of calculated attributes (e.g. taxonomic hierarchy)
        in genomic context
        Used for Process GO annotation
        Evidence asserts component. e.g.
            HMM hit equivalog
            HMM hit to family but not to subfamily
            Other functional annotations (e.g. gene symbol)
        Components or Properties can be asserted manually
        Set of components asserts a property
            ranged assertions (NO, none found, not supported, some evidence, YES)
            some components are optional, and not counted in ranges
        
    BrainGrab is initial Scope
        assume genomic context needed
        data types
            features and locations(ORFs, etc)
            comparative evidence on features (blast hits, hmm hits, or genome property component info)
            other annotations (e.g. go-terms)
            genome info - taxonomy, genome properties
        we should initially assume inputs of
            feature id, locations (molecule=asmbl_id, low_bound, high_bound, frame/strand), annotations (to fill)
            processed hmm hits (strong, weak, hmm_id, hit_id)
            processed blast hits (score, e-value, subject_id, subject_start, subject_end, subject_length, hit_id, hit_start, hit_end, hit_length, %sim)
            genome properties (id, state, value, component_ids)
        output is modified features --
            filling in common name, gene sym, go terms, ec num, role_ids
        
Classes:
    feature
    hmm_hit
    blast_hit
    genome
    genome_property
            
        
    Open Questions:
        can we use outside data sources for initial fact loading (e.g. hibernate or RDF)? see http://magazine.redhat.com/2008/07/11/jboss-drools-meets-hibernate/
