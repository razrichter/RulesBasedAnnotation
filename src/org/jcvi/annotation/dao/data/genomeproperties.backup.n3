The proposed biosynthetic pathway involves the dehydration/isomerization of UDP-D-GlcNAc to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc by PseB, a transamination at position 4 by PseC. The PseH protein is similar to acetyltransferases and is presumed to carry out transfer to the C-4 amine. PseH itself is occasionally missing. Often in this case, the PseG protein contains an passable acetyltransferase domain. The function of PseG when PseH is present is unknown, it may complex with PseH, or ot may be responsible for the UDP-hydrolysis that clearly must happen but is not currently assigned to an enzyme with a conserved domain for this reaction. PseI carries out the condensation with phosphoenolpyruvate to create pseudaminic acid, a reaction analagous to the carried out by NeuB in the biosynthesis of neuraminic acid (GenProp0792). PseF carries out the transfer of CMP onto pseudaminic acid to yield the most common product. In Campylobacter, the biosynthetic cluster is accompanied by the PseA protein, a homolog of WbuX and is responsible for the conversion of the N-acetyl group at position 7 into the acetimidino group. PseA is accompanied by two genes, WbuY and WbuZ which are reported to provide ammonia for the reaction (GenProp0794). Other proteins are found associated with this cluster including methylases and possible formyltransferases and deacetylases. Thus, a range of closely related structures are likely produced as mature products in various lineages. ";

The phylogenetic ranges over which GatABC orthologs act on Glu-tRNA(Gln), Asp-tRNA(Asn), or both are not fully worked out. It is both in Chlamydia, the Thermus-Deinococcus lineage, and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. In the Archaea, GatDE act on Glu-tRNA(Gln) while GatABC act on Asp-tRNA(Asn). In Lactobacillus and possibly all Firmicutes, GatABC acts on Glu-tRNA(Gln) only. Note that the amidotransferase reaction is a mechanism not only to charge a tRNA with Asn or Gln, but to complete the synthesis of that amino acid.";

This locus includes sortase B (SrtB) which functions to localize the IsdC protein to the cell wall peptidoglycan. IsdC is a NEAT domain protein (PF05031) as are IsdX1 and IsdX2. The NEAT domain is proposed to be involved in iron-siderophore transport processes and is likely to mediate heme binding in this system. IsdX1 and IsdX2 are secreted proteins which have the ability to remove heme from hemoglobin, apparently by a direct hemoglobin binding mechanism (as opposed to by virtue of a tighter binding of heme). IsdE-IsdE2-IsdF are an ABC membrane transporter complex, presumably transporting heme into the cell. Finally, IsdG is a cytoplasmic monooxygenase involved in the cleavahe of the heme ring and the liberation of iron.";

The bacteria containing this pathway are believed to have acquired it by lateral transfer, possible in more than one independent event [Wilding, et. al. (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 4319-4327].  Archaea are believed to possess a mevalonate pathway for production of IPP, but several of the steps are divergent from the known enzymes in eukaryotes and have not yet been conclusively identified [PMID: 11042147].  In eukaryotes this pathway is highly regulated to control the production of steroids which require IPP as a precursor. IPP is also required for the synthesis of menaquinone, ubiquinone, terpenoids, isoprene and prenylated proteins. The pathway begins with synthesis of (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA from acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA by HMG-CoA synthase and contains 5 steps all of which are included as required elements for the assignment of the YES state for this property.  Some organisms contain a pathway-specific acetoacetyl-CoA synthase which is included in the gene lists for this property but is not a required element for the determination of the property state. Other species likely obtain acetoacetyl-CoA from beta-oxidation of fatty acids or related processes.";

	:definition	"Lipid A is a component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of most gram-negative bacteria. It is one of three regions of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), along with the oligosaccharide core and the repeating O-antigen. In some strains, O-antigen may be missing and the lipid A-containing material may be designated lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Lipid A consists of a disaccharide (often beta-D-GlcN-(1-->6)-D-GlcN) with four attached acyl groups. Lipid A is attached to a 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO), a sugar moeity that becomes part of the LPS oligosaccharide inner core. Two of acyl groups of lipid A are then modified by further acylations into branched structures; acylation varies somewhat by species, and sometimes according to conditions within a species. The inner core typically contains at least two KDO and two heptose residues. The outer core and O-antigen regions are far more variable, and their biosynthesis is modeled in this property. LPS biosynthesis mutational studies have shown that, in a number of species, lipid A with two KDO residues but no additional residues of the inner core is the minimum required form of LPS for viability, called Re LPS or Re endotoxin. This genome property describes a set of well-conserved enzymes for biosynthesis of KDO(2)-lipid A that resembles but is not necessarily identical to the Re endotoxin of E. coli (nor as active in endotoxin assays), as well as a transporter, or flippase, responsible in most Proteobacteria for positioning lipid A in the outer membrane.";

Targets for the system can often be recognized by a characteristic signal sequence with an Arg-Arg motif. The target proteins usually are predicted to perform redox functions. This property reflects detection of the whole system: components of the translocase and at least one example of a predicted Tat signal sequence. Every system must have at least one TatA homolog (other than TatB) and at least one TatC homolog. TatB occurs only in Proteobacteria and is required at least in E. coli.

Detection of the phosphate acetyltransferase is via a TIGRFAMs equivalog in some cases, while in others the discrimination between substrate specificities for acetate and butyrate (PF01515) is unclear. In the absence of an equivalog hit, when a gene adjacent to the kinase and in an apparent operon and hits the PFAM subfamily and the genomic context does not otherwise indicate the handling of butyrate, the gene will be manually included. A member of PF01515 which is distal from the acetate kinase in Thermotoga has been experimentally characterized [3] and has also been manually included.";

Acetyl-CoA may also be generated independently of pyruvate via the breakdown of other organic compounds. The TCA cycle generates reducing equivalents in the form of NADH. NADH, in turn delivers the electrons to the top of the electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation). This chain results in the pumping of protons (and/or sodium ions) to form a gradient. Ions flowing back with this gradient power the ATP-generation machines of the cell. Oxygen acts as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron-transport chain. ";

BioF (EC 2.3.1.47, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase, also called 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthetase) converts pimeloyl-CoA to 8-amino-7-oxononanoate. BioA (EC 2.6.1.62, adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase) converts the product to 7,8-diaminononanoate, from which BioD (EC 6.3.3.3, dethiobiotin synthase) makes dethiobiotin. BioB (EC 2.8.1.6, biotin synthase) then makes biotin itself. Enzymes such as BioH involved in pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis typically receive biotin-related annotations but may also appear in genomes in which biotin is not synthesized and pimeloyl-CoA is used for something else.";

The protein is membrane-embedded and probably assembles into multimers such that the individual cellulose strands can self-assemble into multi-strand fibrils. The purpose of the endoglucanase which is always present in the same operon with the synthase is not known. Control of the levels of c-diGMP is via pppGpG cyclases and c-diGMP and pGpG phosphodiesterases. All genomes expressing this system have numerous cyclase and phosphodiesterase domain proteins and multiple regulatory circuits are possible.

Where multiple class I enzymes exist in a single organism they are presumed to be under differential regulation.  Note that earlier reports of a manganese-based class IV system related to class I in high GC gram positive species was proved to be spurious [2].  Electrons for this reduction are supplied by glutaredoxin-like (NrdH, in some species [3]), or flavodoxins specific to this system which are in turn reduced by oxygen via thioredoxin reductase. Detection of this component is not required to set the YES state because of incomplete knowledge of the various homologs involved.  Certain class I RNRs are associated with a gene of unknown function (NrdI). NrdI shows up more frequently, but not exclusively in species with more than one class I RNR, so it may be involved in regulation in some way.  ";

	:definition	"Coenzyme B12 (5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin) is biosynthesized in prokaryotes via a complex pathway from uroporphyrinogen III (an intermediate in the biosynthesis of heme) and S-adenosylmethionine, glutamine, cobalt, glycine, acetyl-CoA, beta-nicotinate mononucleotide and dimethylbenzimidazole. This property is the first section, from uroporphyrinogen III to just after colbalt insertion. This version of the pathway includes an oxygen-requiring enzyme (CobG) and differs from the anaerobic pathway in which the cobalt is inserted early in the process by an ATP-independent chelatase (CbiK or CbiX). The other distinctive feature of the aerobic pathway is the C-1 methylase (CobF) which is replaced by the non-homologous CbiD in the anaerobic process.  The cobalt(II) reductase (BluB) which constitutes the final step of this property is also distinctive for the aerobic path, although the anaerobic enzyme(s) have not been well studied.  The well-characterized trimeric ATP-dependent cobaltochelatase (CobNST) is completely detected only in a narrow range of prokaryotes. In a number of other species which appear to otherwise utilize the aerobic pathway, CobST is apparently replaced with another subunit repated to magnesium chelatases which we tentatively refer to here as CobX. For this reason, only the CobN subunit is relied upon here for the assertion of the YES state.  Many species exhibit ony one or two of the components distinctive of the aerobic pathway (and are either aerobes, microaerophiles or facultative anaerobes), possibly indicating non-homologous families as-of-yet uncharacterized.";

	:definition	"This property covers that part of the Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) biosynthesis pathway in which uroporphyrinogen III is converted to cobyrinic acid diamide under anaerobic conditions. This process differs from the aerobic version in several key respects. The most striking is the fact that here the cobalt atom is inserted early in the process (after the formation of the branchpoint compound precorrin-2 by CbiK or CbiX) in an ATP-independent manner, as opposed to the aerobic pathway in which the cobalt is inserted at the end by a multimeric ATP-hydrolyzing system. Another distinctive feature is the nature of the enzyme catalyzing the oxidative ring contraction. In the aerobic pathway, this is carried out by an oxygenase (CobG), while the as-of-yet uncharacterized anaerobic enzyme clearly must utilize some other mechanism. Finally, the methylation at position C-1 at the point of the ring contraction is carried out by CobF in the aerobic pathway, and by an as-of-yet uncharacterized enzyme in the anaerobic pathway (presumably because the proximity of this carbon to the cobalt changes the chemistry somewhat). Two genes (CbiD and CbiG) are found in most anaerobic B12 biosynthetic clusters and have been shown to be essential to the pathway. CbiD is homologous to methylases and is likely to catalyze the C-1 methylation. CbiG then, by process of elimination and (coupled with unique nature of the chemical transformation) its lack of homology to other known classes of enzyme is likely to catalyze the ring contraction.  CbiJ, the analog of precorrin-6x reductase (CobK), is not found in deltaproteobacteria, a number of archaea and a scattering of other species, oftentimes this is the only component missing. Most likely, an unknown reductase replaces CbiJ/CobK in these species. For this reason, the detection of this component is not a requirement for the assertion of YES for this property.  The majority of genomes for which some evidence has been asserted are missing evidence of the CbiK or CbiX chelatase. This step is still required for assertion of the YES state since it is part of the suite of components which are diagnostic for the anaerobic pathway. The evidence for the anaerobic pathway is nonetheless quite strong when this is the only component missing, especially when the aerobic pathway is not supported.";

The native cyanobacterial form is insoluble, while heterogenously expressed cyanophycin synthetases in E. coli may produce a soluble form with some level of Lys substituting for Arg. This polymer is analogous to polyhydroxyalkanoic acid biosynthesis systems with which it sometimes co-occurs.";

Genes associated with this processing are found among exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes, suggesting that PEP-CTERM proteins are part of this exopolysaccharide system, and therefore are likely to be transported across the outer membrane. This property represents a panel of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes where each belongs to a subfamily that marks its host gene as carrying the PEP-CTERM/exopolysaccharide system.  This type 2 version of the system is found in Methylobacillus sp. strain 12S where it is embedded in a region for the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide mthanolan.";

A class III alcohol dehydrogenase, with activity for a variety of medium chain alcohols (but poor activity for ethanol) can convert S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione to S-formylglutathione, and therefore has been called glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase but is more properly called S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase for this activity. Finally, S-formylglutathione is converted to glutathione and formate by S-formylglutathione hydrolase, which has a dual role as a broadly specific esterase, called esterase D in animals. While the two essential enzymes of this pathway both have broad specificities, the pairing in operons in so many genomes demonstrates the recurring importance of formaldehyde detoxification.";

These properties include those whose state can be supported by inference from the genomic data itself as well as those supported by experimental observations. Properties are organized in a type of heirarchy called a Directed Acyclyic Graph (a DAG) in which child terms may have multiple parent terms. Thus, for instance, a property for the biosynthesis of a particular cofactor may be found as a child of both biosynthesis and protein cofactors . Properties come in several types: PATHWAY properties describe metabolic pathways in which a series of enzymes convert substrates into products to produce desirable substances and/or degrade undesirable ones. A set of these steps have been determined to be both 1) unambiguously indicative of the property and 2) as universally detectable as is practical among the species believed to have this pathway active. The presence or absence of these steps in a genome are used to judge the status of the property. Those genomes with all of the set present are given the YES state, those with none are given the NONE FOUND state. Each pathway may be be given a threshold number of detected steps below which the state NOT SUPPORTED  is assigned. Otherwise, the state INCOMPLETE is assigned. Under certain circumstances of additional evidence (such as the presence of a complete alternative pathway) a NONE FOUND state may be strengthened to  NO . SYSTEM properties work in essentially the identical way, except they may not represent a metabolic pathway. In both of these cases the  value field will hold a number representing the fraction of steps used to assign the state of the property which were found in the genome. MARKER properties are similar except that only a single type of protein is detected and serves as an indicator for the presence of a property. Here the value field holds the number of times the marker was detected in the genome. In all three of these types, other proteins outside of the set chosen for determineing the state of the property may also be detected. These may include proteins which are presently detectable only in some species, auxilliary or variable components, regulatory components, etc. Accessions of all of the detected proteins are stored for user retrieval. LITERATURE properties are set based on experimental evidence, not on the content of the sequenced genome. These properties may detect associated proteins which are stored as above. These may also store a number in the value field where apropriate. QUANTITATIVE properties are calculated from the sequenced genome and store a numeric quantity in the value field. TAXONOMY properties store information about the taxonomic classification of the organism. These are based on NCBIs taxonomy database and are used for organizing the output of properties queries to look for trends based on phylogeny. SUMMARY properties are parent properties of one or more related properties whose states are summarized in the state of the parent property.

One of the most efficient osmoprotectants found in the environment is the compound glycine betaine [1]. Both gram positive and gram negative bacteria mediate osmotolerance either by direct uptake of glycine betaine from the environment, or by synthesis from exogenously supplied choline [2,3]. This property reflects the biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine from choline [4,5]. Biosynthesis of glycine betaine occurs via a two-step oxidative reaction requiring a terminal electron acceptor [2,3]. Choline dehydrogenase first catalyzes the conversion of exogenously supplied choline into the intermediate glycine betaine aldehyde, with subsequent oxidization by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase into the osmoprotectant glycine betaine [2,3]. Both choline dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase are required for conversion of choline into glycine betaine [2,3].";

An intrinsic pathogen is capable of causing a disease state in otherwise healthy, nominally normal host individuals. The disease state can be considered to be part of the normal life cycle of an intrinsic pathogen. An intrinsic pathogen may have a long latent period in which the host is asymptomatic, or may fail to cause disease in a significant proportion of a host population due to successful immune responses. This is in contrast to opportunistic pathogens which exploit existing weaknesses such as a compromised immune system. Intrinsic pathogens may be associated with disease outbreaks. ";

	:title	"lysine biosynthesis via diaminopimelate (DAP)";
	:definition	"The basic amino acid lysine is synthesized in most bacteria and plants via a nine step pathway from aspartate (via aspartate semialdehyde which is also used in a number of other pathways). Most species utilize succinate (from succinyl-CoA) to make an important amide linkage in the ring-opening of piperidine dicarboxylate. The succinate is then hydrolyzed several steps later. Other species carry out analogous transformations with acetate (from acetyl-CoA). Chlamydia and cyanobacteria have been shown to utilize a direct aminotransferase path without the acylation/deacylation steps, and a number of other species apparently also use this variant. Each of these variants are included within this property.    A closely related variant (GenProp0788) utilizes the NADPH-dependent enzyme diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (ddh) which incorporates ammonia directly and creates the meso-isomer of diaminopimelate, bypassing the need for the epimerase, DapE. A completely different pathway via alpha-amino adipate exists in fungi and certain bacteria (GenProp0193).   Certain obligate intracellular organisms such as Coxiella, Rickettsia and Wolbachia contain all but the final step of this pathway (diaminopimelate decarboxylase). Presumably these organisms have no need of lysine biosynthesis, being able to obtain it from their hosts. The products of the penultimate two steps, however, (LL- and meso-diaminopimelate) are required components of the bacterial cell wall and so the rest of the pathway persists. The formal possibility that the decarboxylase exists in these organsims but is undetected requires that the state of this property remain some evidence  as opposed to NO .";

This enzyme requires both ammonia as a nitrogen source (instead of an amino acid via a transaminase) and reductive power in the form of NADPH. Additionally, this pathway does not require the acetyl/succinyl protecting group transformations found in the standard pathway, nor does it require the action of diaminopimelate epimerase. This enzyme has been best characterized in Corynebacterium glutamicum and Bacillus sphaericus.  One should note that the ddh enzyme is shown acting on the compound L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate in EC and KEGG representations.

In a number of species, transformation is enabled during a state termed competence, where a number of competence proteins have been described [1]. Failure to induce competence under laboratory conditions or to detect homologs of known competence proteins does not necessarily mean that no natural transformation can occur. Note that some species, including Haemophilus influenzae, have many copies of a DNA update recognition sequence in their DNA and preferentially take up DNA that contains these sequences. E. coli does not show competence for natural transformation but has homologs of many competence genes. It is suggested that DNA is imported for nutrition [2]. Additionally, low frequency plasmid transformation enabled by a specific recognition sequence was shown [3].";

	:definition	"Denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate via three distinct nitrate reductase systems. Two of these are assciated with energy-conserving electron transport systems, distinguished by cellular location and generation of a proton motive force, and the other with nitrate assimilation. All three types involve binding of molybdopterin to the active site of nitrate reductase where reduction occurs. Unlike membrane-associated nitrate reductases, periplasmic nitrate reductase cannot itself act as a coupling site for proton translocation, but can participate indirectly in respiration by virtue of the consumption of electrons derived from NADH via the proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase. Expressed aerobically as well as anearobically in gram-negative bacteria, periplasmic nitrate reductase is a two-subunit enzyme comprised of a catalytic subunit binding molybdopterin and containing a twin-arginine signal motif, and a cytochrome subunit, whose redox partner is a membrane-bound electron transfer protein. Other essential components for this denitrifying system include a proposed chaperone, and at least five other components identified in different combinations in different bacteria [1]. Lacking the membrane-bound c-type cytochrome component, in Wolinella succinogenes electron transport to nitrate reductase from one or more of these other gene products has been demonstrated [2].";

Most proteins of the regulon occur in a single operon, but at least one member, pspG, is located elsewhere in most genomes. The signature genes of the the phage shock regulon are the sigma-54-dependent positive regulator PspF, PspA which binds to and inhibits PspF, and PspB and PspC which act together as both regulatory and effector proteins of the phage shock regulon. PspG occurs in most but not all phage shock-positive genomes, while PspD and PspE are found only in a minority of phage shock operons.";

	:definition	"The degradation of phenylacetic acid via phenylacetyl-CoA to TCA intermediates is the core of an extended catabolon [1] for the degradation of various monosubstituted phenyl compounds and polymers including styrene, tropic acid, ethylbenzene, 2-phenylethylamine, phenylacetyl amide, phenyl alkanoates, poly-hydroxyphenylalkanoates, and trans-styrylacetic acid.  The pathway consists of four major stages: ligation of phenylacetic acid with CoA, hydroxylation of the phenyl ring at the 2-position, oxidative ring opening and fatty-acid beta-oxidation like steps on the acyclic compound. The precise nature of the intermediates following 2-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA are not known.  The gene symbol nomenclature for the enzymes in this pathway has been standardized in [1] due to the heterogeneity among the various organisms studied. This new standard is different from all of the old gene symbols, and may add somewhat to the confusion. A key is reproduced below as an aid to the bewildered.  The genes of this pathway are typically organized into a single divergon. Some of the genes involved in the final fatty-acid-like degradation (paaABCDE) are occasionally absent and presumably substituted with genes of similar function found elsewhere in the genome. paaA and paaB both code for genes having the same general function (enoyl-CoA hydratases), but often paaA is absent (possibly paaB in these organisms provides both activities). paaD is the most reliable marker of this part of the pathway, nearly always detectable as a distinct homolog within the gene clusters. paaN, which codes for the ring-opening enzyme, is generally related to aldehyde dehydrogenases, but at least three different homology families appear to have evolved members into the specific paaN role. Pseudomonas putida appears to include a transport system (paaLM), but as this has not been reported in any other organism it has not been included in this Genome Property at this time.

The model for PhnX (TIGR01422) effectively identifies the clade of enzymes which are associated with the PhnW enzyme that provides the substrate for the reaction. Genes mosty closely related to PhnX (modelled by TIGR03351, HpnX) share a significant degree of similarity at critical catalytic sites suggesting that it, too, acts as a phosphonatase on a beta-phosphonoaldehyde. HpnX genes are often found in the vicinity of (and uniformly in the same genomes with) a family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases (TIGR03364, HpnW). These genes may act in an analagous fashion to PhnW by converting an aminophosphonate into an aldehyde, here by oxidative deamination. HpnW genes are members of a larger family of genes (PF01266) including enzymes with amino acid deaminating oxidase activities. This pair of genes often also is associated with a family of Zn++ dependent alcohol dehydrogenases of the PF00107 family (TIGR0####). Other genes in the vicinity of these three indicate a phosphonate-related context and are typically observed near other phosphonate catabolic pathways such as genes of the HDIG domain family (PF01966), certain GntR-type transcriptional regulators and phosphonate-related transporters.";

One hallmark is the presence of a paralogous domain at the C-termini of a substantial number of proteins in a single genome, usually from four to sixty-five. Features of this domain, described by TIGRFAMs model TIGR02595, are a conserved motif PEP, a transmembrane domain, and a cluster of basic residues for a total length of about 24 amino acids. We call this domain PEP-CTERM, and note that is shares a number of properties with the the LPXTG-type Gram-positive cell-wall targeting sequence. Another hallmark of this system is the presence of one or more homologs of EpsH (TIGR02602), a highly hydrophobic protein that spans the membrane eight or more times. Its surrounding genes nearly always pertain to exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. We have proposed that TIGR02602 models a transpeptidase that cleaves PEP-CTERM proteins, attaches them transiently to an active site Cys, then attaches them covalently to an unknown substrate for sorting to the outer surface of the cell, closely analogous to the action of sortase in Gram-positive bacteria. We suggest the name exosortase for EpsH homologs involved in this process. In Proteobacterial species with a the PEP-CTERM/exsortase system, a sensor histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a sigma-54-dependent DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) are present and appear to bind a conserved regulatory site found upstream of most PEP-CTERM genes.";

	:definition	"Detoxification of inorganic and organic mercury compounds involves the enzymatic reduction of extracellular mercuric ions or organomercurials into less-toxic metallic mercury, where it is released into the cytoplasm and volatiles from the cell. Mercuric ions diffuse across the outer membrane by a mer transport system, which binds and transfers mercury ions via a pair of cysteine residues to the active site of a mercuric reductase. Alternatively, an organomercurial lyase is required for hydrolysis of the carbon-mercury bond of organomercurial compounds before reduction proceeds. Transcribed separately and divergently, a mercury-sensitive transcriptional activator both positively and negatively regulates mer expression, while a co-transcribed secondary regulatory protein down-regulates this mer operon. This resistance system, often encoded on plasmids and transferred via transposons, is found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [1].";

	:definition	"L-rhamnose, (aka 6-deoxy-L-mannose) is a common sugar synthesized and utilized in oligosaccharides and glcyolipids by many bacteria [2]. The monosaccharide is available in various environments and thus regulatory, transport and enzymatic systems have also evolved for its breakdown and use as a carbon source. The system modeled here includes specific transporters, ketose-aldose isomerases, kinases, and aldolases which result in the production of lactaldehyde and glycerone-phosphate. As these genes are generally organized into operons, assignments can be made for regulatory components as well as transport and enzymatic components which, by homology alone, cannot be assigned a specific substrate. Certain of the enzymes in this system are similar enough to cognate enzymes in the fucose catabolism system (GenProp0458) as to have caused gene naming errors in the past (i.e. fuculokinase/rhamnokinase). The system in certain rhizobial species [1] has been reported to vary from the canonical pathway in that the sugar may be phosphorylated prior to isomerization (i.e. the rhamnulokinase may in fact be a rhamnokinase and the rhamnose isomerase may be a rhamnose-1-phosphate isomerase), although this has not yet been independantly verified. In addition to the characterized rhamnose:proton symporter [3], rhamnose catabolism operons contain transporters from the ABC, and major facilitator families. Regulators are generally members of the DeoR and AraC [4] families. The product of both rhamnose and fucose catabolism is lactaldehyde, and subsequently alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases are often present in those operons to convert it to either 1,2-propane diol or lactate depending on oxidation conditions [5]. Rhamnose operons also often contain an epimerase (mutarotase) enzyme which has been proposed to be essential unly under limiting L-rhamnose conditions [6]. Partial rhamnose catabolism operons have been detected in Thermotoga species which appear to handle the import and cleavage of rhamnose-containing oligosaccharides.";

This chemically challenging step is carried out be a number of distinctly different enzyme systems [1]. Each of these systems utilizes a different mechanism for the generation of a transient cysteine-thiyl radical which initiates the reduction of the substrate. Class I enzymes utilize a diferric non-heme iron cluster to generate a stable tyrosine radical [2]. Note that earlier reports of a manganese-based class IV system related to class I in high GC gram positive species was proved to be spurious [3]. Class II enzymes utilize adenosylcobalamin (vitamin B12) [4]. Class III enzymes utilize radical-SAM domain proteins to generate stable glycine radicals [5].  A very small number of genomes appear to be devoid of ribonucleotide reductase sequences, Mycoplasma arthritidis 158L3-1, Mycoplasma bovis Donetta PG45, Ureaplasma urealyticum parvum biovar serovar 3, Borrelia burgdorferi B31 and Borrelia garinii PBi. Each of these is a reduced genome with a limited metabolic portfolio, however other mycoplasma species do contain RNRs. Three possibilities are likely, 1) these genomes harbor a non-orthologous RNR, 2) these genes are located on plasmids or small chromosomes which were lost prior to genomic sequencing (Borrelia, in particular has a number of small chromosomes and plasmids which were sequenced) or 3) these species strictly rely on import of deoxyribonucleic acid from the host environment.";

	:definition	"The property of incorporating selenocysteine as an alternate amino acid during protein translation from mRNA. The site of incorporation often aligns to an active site Cys residue of a homologous protein in a selenocysteine-negative species. One required element is a selenocysteine-specific tRNA (selC) to recognize a TGA codon in the appropriate context. Two required proteins are a selenocysteine-specific elongation factor (SelB), and a selenium donor protein (selD) that may participate in other systems in addition or instead (selenouridine biosynthesis, and selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylase maturation). Finally, a mechanism for converting the serine placed on selenocysteine-specific tRNA into selenocysteine is required. This is achieved by seryl-t RNA(sec) selenium transferase (SelA) in bacteria, but in a two-step process starting with phosphorylation in the Archaea and Eukaryota. Note that SelD may itself be a selenoprotein, and so may appear truncated by a stop codon, thus not triggering the rule to assign the selenocysteine property automatically. Before the state of this property is set to YES , an example of a potential selenocysteine-containing protein must be manually annotated. Commonly observed selenoproteins include the selenium donor protein SelD (selenide, water dikinase) and subunits of formate dehydrogenase, thioredoxin reductase, glycine reductase, heterodisulfide reductase, methylviologen-reducing hydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase. In certain species all components of the system can be found save the SelC tRNA (including examples) even after a manual search. These are given the state PARTIAL to indicate the possibility that either the ability to incorporate selenocysteine has been lost (and the examples are actually truncated or not expressed) or an as-of-yet undescribed tRNA system exists in these species. The selenium donor protein seems to occur in some species that lack the selenium-specific tRNA, elongation factor, and transferase. This usually reflects the incorporation of selenium into certain tRNAs. Note also that selenium is sometimes used to label proteins in vitro, so not every literature reference to selenocysteine implies incorporation during translation. An analogous system, discovered more recently, incorporates pyrrolysine at specific TAG codons.";

These natural products include antibiotics, siderophores, toxins and other compounds of biological and economic importance.   These products are synthesized on large proteins called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) which specify the amino acids to be added by the sequence of amino acid adenylation (activation) domains along the synthetase. NRPSs may utilize many more amino acids than the 20 to which the ribosomes are limited. In addition, NRPSs may form linkages between side-chain amino and carboxylate groups and may contain domains which catalyze epimerization, methylation, cross-linking, cyclization, oxidation, reduction and other modifications to the growing peptide chain. Chain initiation may incorporate fatty acids (in the case of lipodepsipeptides) or other non-amino acid, carboxylate-containing compounds and NRPSs may work in concert with polyketide synthetases to form hybrid peptide-ketide natural products.  NRPSs, like type I polyketide synthetases, work via a thio-template mechanism in which the activated units are transferred to the thiol of bound pantetheine groups in a thio-ester linkage (of the amino acid carboxylates). Condensation domains then join two thioester-bound units to form a peptide bond. Release of the complete polypeptide chain may be via cyclization or through the action of a thioesterase or thioester reductase.   Many of the constituent domains of NRPSs have been defined by HMM models. These include adenylation (AMP-binding enzyme, PF00501), condensation (PF00668), acyl/peptidyl carrier protein (thiolation, pantetheine-binding, PF00550), thioesterase (PF00975) and thioester reductase (TIGR01746) domains. In addition, the pantetheine binding domains are identified by a pair of PROSITE motifs (PS00012, PS50075).  The minimal components of an NRPS are the C (condensation), A (adenylation) and T (thiolation) domains which are commonly organized into CAT modules. NRPSs are detected as genes which contain hits to all three of these domains. Genomes with at least one ORF which fulfills this condition will be assigned the YES state for this property. The value field will hold the number of ORFs found to be NRPSs. NRPSs may, however, be broken up into multiple genes at domain boundaries and thus the possibility exists of missing NRPS genes which are short and broken up into pieces having only two of the three essential domains. If the state NO has been set, this indicates that the genome has been manually reviewed.   ";

The name Nus, for N-utilization substance, reflects the phenomenology of exploitation of N factors for phage lambda in Escherichia coli. Much of the literature of these transcription termination/anti-termination factors revolves around the interaction with the transcription termination factor Rho, but factor Rho and cis-acting rho-utilization sites are less well distributed than the N-factors, which are essentially universal in bacteria. In species with Rho, Nus factors improve transcriptase turnover speeds. Nus factors can block Rho action, a process called anti-termination.

However, release factor 2 in most bacteria is encoded by a gene with a programmed frameshift about 25 amino acids from the N-terminus. It may be annotated incorrectly as a truncated or disrupted gene and therefore not detected by its HMM, TIGR00020. A fourth protein included in this genome property is the ribosome recycling factor, which also partipates in processes at the conclusion of bacterial protein translation.

The hydrolase may be unnecessary in some organisms as the hydroxyisourate will hydrolyze spontaneously, albeit an a slow rate. The resulting product (OHCU) then spontaneously decarboxylates, resulting in a mixture of (S)- and (R)-allantoin. For further catabolism, generally only (S)-allantoin is processed, so allantoin racemace is also typically found.

Associated with these structural subunits are accessory factors functioning to assemble and incorporate its nickel-containing metallocenter [3]. This property predicts a urease system to be present if both its three structural subunits and four accessory proteins are all found.
